Starting in 2019, former President Donald Trump required tens of thousands of migrants who attempted to seek asylum in the United States to temporarily stay on the Mexican side of the border — often in makeshift camps — while awaiting court proceedings. Critics called the policy inhumane and dangerous, pointing to scores of kidnappings and assaults of asylum-seekers who were forced to stay in Mexican border cities. Biden gradually unwound MPP earlier this year and allowed many of its enrollees to enter the United States.
